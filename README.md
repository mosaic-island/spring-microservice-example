# Spring Microservice Example

This is an example project of building and deploying a Spring Boot &amp; Spring Cloud based micro-service architecture.
It will be configured using Docker Compose and be capable of deploying to Amazon ECS. We will base it on the demo/tutorial
from Okta [here](https://github.com/oktadev/java-microservices-examples/tree/main/spring-cloud-gateway)
This should be considered a technical demonstrator used for exploring Spring Cloud and micro-service architectures.
It is not a functional or production ready application and comes with no guarantees or support.

## Technologies to be used and demonstrated

We aim to use all the latest and greatest developments within Spring, Spring Cloud, the JVM language space and Kotlin, to name but a few.
Below is a more complete list of the technologies we aim to use/demonstrate.
* Kotlin
* Spring Boot
* Gradle
* Spring WebFlux reactive endpoints
* Spring Cloud
  * Config Server
  * Discovery Service
  * API Gateway
  * Extras
    * Kafka
    * Modulith
